The following CSS code snippet is designed to create a responsive layout using flexbox. However, it introduces an uncommon error where the inner divs unexpectedly overlap when the screen width shrinks below a certain point.  The expected behavior is for the inner divs to wrap to the next line when there's insufficient horizontal space, but instead they stack on top of each other. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  width: 50%;
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

The solution addresses the overlap issue by adding the `flex-wrap: wrap;` property to the container. This explicitly tells the flexbox to wrap the items onto multiple lines when there isn't enough horizontal space.  We also modify the `width` to use `flex-basis` instead which helps with responsiveness.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.item {
  flex-basis: 50%;
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
